dreams a swirl color

once of darkness. now another

rays ablaze of sun so holy

echo through chambers moldy

gliding along waves un-tempered

vast existence though lost omniscience

Part 1: A chamber

A soft glow begins to form along the chamber's roof, gently illuminating the shadows. In the distance, a mechanism clinks away rhythmically, each sound punctuating the growing intensity of the light. As the glow swells, the mechanismâ€™s steady thumping builds to a final resonant thunk that echoes through the chamber. Suddenly, ambient light floods the room, revealing its vast expanse. Four narrow rays pierce through the heart of the chamber, suspended in a delicate, intersecting dance.
